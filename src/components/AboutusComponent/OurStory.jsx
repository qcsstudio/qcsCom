              was founded with a purposeâ€”to bridge the widening gap between education and employability,
              between what students learn and what businesses truly need. It all began when our founder,
              while mentoring aspiring tech professionals, noticed a recurring issue: students were
              equipped with theoretical knowledge but lacked hands-on industry skills, and startups
              lacked smart, affordable digital solutions. What started as a mentorship initiative
              quickly evolved into a full-fledged mission to empower businesses with AI-powered tools
              and prepare the next generation of tech talent through real-world training. From a single
              vision, QuantumCrafters has grown into a trusted name in IT services,
              <Link href="https://elevatrx.app/"><span className="font-bold hover:text-[#F1813B]"> SaaS product development</span></Link>, and career-focused training across India.
