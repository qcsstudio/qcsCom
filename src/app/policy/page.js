          The following Terms of Service ("Service Terms") apply specifically to the products and services offered by QuantumCrafters Studio Private Limited, including our AI-powered solutions, SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) subscriptions, IT consulting services, and institutional training/mentorship programs. These Service Terms are in addition to (and incorporate) our general Terms and Conditions above, but are tailored to the nature of the services you purchase or use from us. In case of any conflict, the more specific term (either here or in a separately signed contract for a particular service) will take precedence for that service.

          By procuring or using any of these services, you agree to these Service Terms. If you are an organization, the individual accepting these terms on your behalf represents that they have authority to bind the organization.
